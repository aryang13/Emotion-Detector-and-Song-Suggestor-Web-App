You might want to try face detectors such as MTCNN before feeding the images to the model. This would help if faces are not typically in the center of the image, and cropped images do not have faces properly positioned. Even for your deployed model, it might help to first detect face, and then do emotion analysis on that. Random cropping of the image around the center also helps in improving accuracy in many cases.

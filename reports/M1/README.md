Milestone M1 report






Steve He:
Since we are planning to host the website using google cloud service, I have tried to deploy some simple (non-ML related) dynamic website using through Django. And users are able to visit our website given the public address of our hosting machien.
Also, I tried to run through some simple ML project like perceptron on the cloud Linux VM and it went well (meaning we can do computation on the cloud machine).
